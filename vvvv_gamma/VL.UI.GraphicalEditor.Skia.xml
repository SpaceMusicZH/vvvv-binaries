            <remarks>
            The relation between the polygons points, its position and its anchor are as follows:
            - points are interpreted relative to the position
            - the anchor specifies how the position relates to the points bounding rectangle
            The two recommended ways of using a polygon are therefore:
            - either specify points in a way that they assume position is their topleft corner and then use the anchor to move the polygon around in respect to the position
            - or don't touch the anchor and specify points relatively around the position
