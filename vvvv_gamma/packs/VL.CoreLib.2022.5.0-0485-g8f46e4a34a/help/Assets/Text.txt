While for vvvv beta, VL is just another language it supports, for vvvv gamma, VL is the core. 
As such, both beta and gamma will continue to profit as we progress with VL. 
We are well aware of the fact that gamma is not going to replace beta for everyone anytime soon. 
We're therefore commited to support both equally for the foreseeable future.
