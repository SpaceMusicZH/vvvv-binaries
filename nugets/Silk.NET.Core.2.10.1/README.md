# About This Package

Core functionality for the Silk.NET library. You likely never need to reference this package yourself, nor is it generally useful without another Silk.NET package.



# Features

### Performance
Having poured lots of hours into examining generated C# code and its JIT assembly, you can count on us to deliver blazing fast bindings with negligible overhead induced by Silk.NET!

### Up-to-date
With an efficient bindings regeneration mechanism, we are committed to ensuring our bindings reflect the latest specifications with monthly updates generated straight from the upstream sources.

### High-level utilities
In addition to providing high-speed, direct, and transparent bindings, we provide high-level utilities and wrappers to maximise productivity in common workloads such as platform-agnostic abstractions around Windowing and Input, bringing your apps to a vast number of platforms without changing a single line!

### Good-to-go
Silk.NET caters for anything you could need in swift development of multimedia, graphics, compute applications. Silk.NET is an all-in-one solution, complete with Graphics, Compute, Audio, Input, and Windowing.

# Building from source

Prerequisites
- **Must**: .NET 6 SDK
- **Should**: Android (w/ AOT), iOS, and MAUI .NET 6 workloads (use `dotnet workload install android android-aot ios maui` to install them)
- **Should**: Android SDK version 30 with NDK tools installed
- **Could**: Java JDK (for gradle)
- **Could**: Visual Studio 2019 Community version 16.10 or later

Instructions
- Clone the repository (recursively)
- Run build.sh, build.cmd, build.ps1, or `nuke compile`. By default all packages targeting .NET Core, Standard, or .NET 6 are built. To build our older Xamarin iOS and Android packages, add the `--feature-sets legacy-ios legacy-android` arguments.
- Use the DLLs. To get nupkgs you can use with NuGet instead, use `nuke pack`.

There are more advanced build actions you can do too, such as FullBuild, Pack, FullPack, among others which you can view by doing `nuke --plan`.

The older Xamarin projects will not build properly without being configured to use Desktop MSBuild (i.e. the MSBuild shipped with Visual Studio). As a result, you will ideally need to be on Windows and have Visual Studio 2019 Community (v16.10 or greater) installed with .NET Core and Xamarin workloads. If you don't have this (i.e. because you're on Linux or Mac), you won't be able to build the older Xamarin packages.
